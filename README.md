# React Portfolio [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This project is a port of the portfolio I made for my second assignment in Bootcamp to React from static HTML.
Revisiting my original code, I was struck by my then reluctance to rely on Bootstrap classes and/or obvious templates-I wanted to do things myself, and I wasn't sure where the line stood on plagiarism.
I tried to keep some of those idiosyncrasies in this version, while also taking advantage of everything I've learned and all the tools I now have available. This approach complicated code organization and client-side rendering, but I liked the idea of approaching my old portfolio as a legacy codebase I was contracted to update rather then rebuild.
The result is not, perhaps, the most polished or sophisticated possible portfolio, but it wholly replicates the original while adding some new, React-based functionality.

## Installation

The page is live at [https://mavn2.github.io/react_portfolio/#/](https://mavn2.github.io/react_portfolio/#/). My portfolio can be also viewed on your local server by cloning this repository, running "npm install" within the enclosing folder to install required dependencies, then launching it with "npm start." If there are no port conflicts, the page can then be visited at [http://localhost:3000/#/](http://localhost:3000/#/).

## Usage

The buttons embedded in the column headers will sort the displayed users. The search bar is case-sensitive but dynamic, narrowing the field of results as a user enters text.

## Contributing

If anything about my work here is useful to you, let me know! I'd also love feedback on my code, as I'm new to React and find it extremely compelling.

## Tests

None really apply here, but follow the instructions in [Usage](Usage) to put the app through its paces.

## Questions
